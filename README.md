# RN487x-BM7x-Firmware-Upgrade-using-Host-MCU

## Introduction
The general firmware update process in the RN4870/1 and BM70/71 PICtail board is carried out using an isupdate flashing tool. The instruction guide for the RN and BM devices discusses in detail about the firmware flashing using the system based flashing tool. Based on Microchipâ€™s continuous improvement policy we are focused on collecting the feedback from the customers, to fulfill the field requirements to make the product more reliable to the end users. Taking into consideration about few practical requirements that demand for an embedded application to execute firmware update for these devices, we have developed an alternative solution to execute firmware update for the controller devices.
      The alternative approach is designed to achieve the same task using an embedded application that execute the firmware update on the RN4870/1 and BM70/71 PICtail board is by using the host MCU.  The embedded application implements the firmware update protocol using the Host Controller interface. This document discusses in detail about the application execution and step by steps procedure to achieve the firmware update via the host MCU using UART based device firmware update protocol.
Microchip releases periodic updates to the application firmware to include new features and fix any bugs reported in previous release. These updates are provided with a release note along with the firmware files in the official webpage.
